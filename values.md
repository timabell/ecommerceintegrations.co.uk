## Our Values

* Empathy.
* Honesty.
* Excellent communication:
	* Taking the time to explain complicated technical issues in a way that makes sense to you. So many in the engineering space treat their users like idiots, when they are intelligent people that have chosen to focus their learning elsewhere. We don't hide the truth from you because "you wouldn't understand", instead we help you understand so you can make the best decisions for your business.
* A desire to make you, your customers and your staff successful.
* Inclusivity:
	* We have all walked different paths in life. We value you for you.
* Technical excellence.
* Positivity and encouragement:
	* We assume the best intentions of others, and give the best of ourselves to help others
* Humility & confidence:
	* Tech is infinitely complicated and we can't know everything, but we have the skills to help you be better than you were without us.
* Standing by our moral values:
	* Sorry, we don't think gambling or payday loans are good for our society so won't be working with these kinds of clients
* Doing what you really need, not just what you tell us you need, and communicating how we can help you better than you could have imagined.
* Lifelong learning.

These values come from the founder's heart, and guide everything we do, who we work with, who we hire to create great experiences.

If we fall short, we want to know about it.

This is a living document and will grow with us.
