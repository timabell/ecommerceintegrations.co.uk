## Our Values

* Technical excellence.
* Honesty.
* Excellent communication:
	* Taking the time to explain complicated technical issues in a way that makes sense to you. So many in the engineering space treat their users like idiots, when they are intelligent people that have chosen to focus their learning elsewhere. We don't hide the truth from you because "you wouldn't understand", instead we help you understand so you can make the best decisions for your business.
* A desire to make clients and their customers and staff successful.
* Positivity and encouragement:
	* We assume the best intentions of others, and give the best of ourselves to help others
* Inclusivity.
* Standing by our moral values:
	* Sorry, we don't think gambling or payday loans are good for our society so won't be working with these kinds of clients
