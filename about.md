As of August 2021 Charm Consulting is growing its delivery capability beyond the founder's own skills and switching focus to systems integration, along with a new trading name of "eCommerce Integrations".

## Systems Integration

We offer systems integration services to eCommerce businesses looking to streamline operations, eliminate manual processes and give a better a service to customers.

We are specialising in using [Codeless Platform's Business Process Automation]([https://www.codelessplatforms.com/business-process-automation-platform/) (BPA) to solve your integration problems, but will consider other solutions including leveraging our extensive custom software development experience.

## Trading Names

"eCommerce Integrations" is a trading name of Charm Consulting Ltd.

As a solo contractor Tim Abell (founder) has to date operated under the limited company Charm Consulting Ltd.

As we switch focus to systems integration and grow the business we will be operating under the new name "eCommerce integrations" name.

The limited-company will be renamed to match in due course.
